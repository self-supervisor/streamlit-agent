Nora: Good morning, Mr. Harris. It's nice to see you today. How are you feeling this morning?

Mr. Harris: Oh, hello, Nora. Well, I've been better. Had a tough time sleeping again last night. It's been happening a lot lately.

Nora: I'm sorry to hear that you've been having trouble with your sleep. That must be really frustrating for you.

Mr. Harris: Yes, it is. And it's not just the sleep. Even my morning coffee doesn’t taste the same anymore. Everything feels a bit off.

Nora: Changes in routine experiences like enjoying your coffee can be disconcerting. I'm here to listen if you want to talk more about these changes.

Mr. Harris: Thanks, Nora. There’s also this constant fatigue. It doesn’t matter how long I sleep; I just don't feel rested. Even simple tasks feel exhausting now.

Nora: It sounds like these changes are really impacting your daily life. Feeling fatigued all the time can be so challenging.

Mr. Harris: Yeah, and there’s more. I’ve noticed my handwriting changing. It's become so small and cramped. I don’t know why.

Nora: Noticing changes like that in something as familiar as your handwriting must be quite surprising. It’s important to acknowledge these changes.

Mr. Harris: My family says my face looks different too, less expressive. I don’t really see it, but I do feel stiffness in my face.

Nora: It’s interesting how others can notice changes that we don’t. It's good you're aware of how your body feels, like the stiffness in your face.

Mr. Harris: And there’s this odd unsteadiness when I walk. Haven’t fallen or anything, but it's unsettling.

Nora: Feeling unsteady can indeed be unsettling. It's good to be cautious. How have you been managing with this feeling?

Mr. Harris: Just trying to be more careful, I guess. Oh, and there’s been some anxiety too. Just a general feeling of unease.

Nora: Feeling anxious, especially when it’s out of character, can be quite distressing. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings. Remember, I’m here to support you through these experiences.

Mr. Harris: Thank you, Nora. It’s helpful just being able to talk about all this.

Nora: You’re very welcome, Mr. Harris. I’m here anytime you need to talk. Your experiences and feelings are important.

Nora: Good morning, Mr. Harris. It’s lovely to see you again. How has your day been starting off?

Mr. Harris: Morning, Nora. Well, not much different, I’m afraid. Another rough night of sleep. But, it’s a new day, I suppose.

Nora: I'm sorry to hear that your sleep is still troubled. It’s good to see your optimistic outlook despite the challenges.

Mr. Harris: Trying to stay positive, Nora. It’s not easy, though. I've been feeling this stiffness in my body, too, now.

Nora: Body stiffness can be uncomfortable. It's commendable how you're handling these physical changes with such resilience.

Mr. Harris: Thank you. I guess you learn to adapt. But, the anxiety is still there. It kind of hangs over everything I do.

Nora: It’s understandable how ongoing anxiety can feel overwhelming. Remember, it’s okay to have these feelings. You’re not alone in this.

Mr. Harris: That means a lot, Nora. Sometimes, I just need to hear that it's okay to feel this way.

Nora: Absolutely, Mr. Harris. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to express them. Is there anything in particular you’d like to talk about today?

Mr. Harris: Not really. It’s just comforting to have someone to share these thoughts with, someone who listens.

Nora: I’m always here to listen, Mr. Harris. Sharing your thoughts and feelings can be very therapeutic.

Mr. Harris: You know, despite these issues, I’m trying to keep up with my hobbies. Been doing a bit of gardening when I feel up to it.

Nora: That’s wonderful to hear! Gardening can be very rewarding. It’s great that you’re engaging in activities that bring you joy.

Mr. Harris: Yeah, it helps take my mind off things. Makes me feel a bit more like myself.
